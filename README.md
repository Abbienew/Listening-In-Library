# Listening-In-Library

《 Listening In Library 》creates a virtual library environment with soundscape and “audiobooks” and other sounds which are produced in local libraries. People can be anywhere in the world and immediately be in the library with the library’s soundscape in a web-based virtual audio experience library.
